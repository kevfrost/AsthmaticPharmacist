Inhalers etc.

Code associated in my work as a respiratory pharmacist.  Inhalers.py is a python script that pulls data from the OpenPrescribing API then combines with the codes in inhalers.csv to produce the table output.csv which shows the carbon per inhaler for each GP surgery in the Bradford and Craven CCG for the past 5 years.
